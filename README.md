Description:

This week, you'll build a portfolio page, which you can add to as the course progresses.

A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies.

With these points in mind, in this homework youâ€™ll be applying the core skills you've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.
